		<figure>Fig. 1. (Color online) Community scoring functions for real-world ground-truth communities (sold lines) in different time windows (2004-2008, 1994-2003, 1960-1981, 1982-2008 and 1960-2008). Results from the randomized versions (10% and 100%) of the ground-truth communities are presented in the right-most panel (indicated by RN). For better visualization, all the functional values are rescaled between 0 and 1. In each slice of the figure, Pearsons correlation coefficient () between two similar functions is reported. </figure>
		<figure>Fig. 2. (Color online) Average distribution pattern of inward citations (with variances) for a paper after publication (inset: same measure for every field). </figure>
		<figure>Fig. 3. (Color online) (a) Top two scientific communities (based on inwardness) at the forefront of scientific research trend (names of topmost backup communities for the communities in the forefront of every trend-window are mentioned). Cause analysis: Fig.(b) fraction of papers for top and second ranked communities among the 10% high impact papers in each year; Fig.(c) change of citations from the topmost backup communities; Fig.(d) fraction of papers for top and second ranked communities among the 10% highly influential papers in each trend-window. To smoothen the curves, the best sliding window size of five years has been used. </figure>
