Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.

Fig. 17 shows that the experimentally obtained spatial coher- ence is consistent with the theoretical predictions made using the model developed in this paper, confirming its validity. It also shows that, in GNSS-based SAR, spatial decorrelation effects are not so dramatic as in the traditional spaceborne SAR cases and can be further minimized by choosing the appropriate satellite trajectories for change detection. In this example, even a time offset of 15 s between repeat passes leads to a spatial coherence higher than 0.9. There are some deviations between the theoretical and practical results in Fig. 17, which may be attributed to the complexity of the target structures and the experiment itself. Even so, these deviations appear at temporal image separations (10 s or longer) which are not expected in practice.
